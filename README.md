# Forward-Feed-Neural-Network
Fully Connected Forward Feed Neural Network 
This is a Toy Project for understanding of a Full Connected Forward Feed Neural Network (FFNN) and back-propogation algorithm. 
I constructed a this FFNN using only matrix operations from numpy (Matrix Products, vector dotproducts, vector outer products.
It was important for me togather a better mathematicalidea of the FFNN and Back-Propogation algorithm prior to using
better /optimized tools. I.e TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.
