# Forward-Feed-Neural-Network

Currently WIP:

This is a Toy Project for understanding of a Full Connected Forward Feed Neural Network (FFNN) as well as implement back-propogation algorithm. I constructed a this FFNN using only matrix operations from numpy (Matrix Products, vector dotproducts, vector outer products.
It was important for me to gather a better mathematical idea of the FFNN and Back-Propogation algorithm prior to using
better /optimized tools. I.e TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. 

To update:
-Construct NN Class
-Update indecies for backpropogation algorithm for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for improved readability 
-Completely Classify FFNN following E Fiesler's paper "Neural Network Classification and Formalization"
